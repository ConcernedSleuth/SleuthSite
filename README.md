# Hout Bay sleuth

I want to find and uncover stories in my neighbourhood, talking to locals and hunting for stories that might otherwise slip through the cracks. Whether itâ€™s an investigative piece on Michael Mac iver thinks it is okay to flash his neighbours or how Helen Snell convinced the SEBCID to pay for her lawsuits against her neighbours. Uncovering the truth one story at a time.

## What is the Hout Bay sleuth?

Come along with me as I explore local Hout Bay stories that often get overlooked in favor of big global headlines! I've discovered that some of the wildest and most interesting things are happening right in our neighbourhoods, way more fascinating than what you usually see on your timeline...

## Website

[View the site here](https://houtbaysleuth.co.za/)

For my own safety, I will keep my identity anonymous. [Michael Mac Iver](https://houtbaysleuth.co.za/person/MichaelMac.html) has a history of attacking those that come in contact with him, regardless of whose side they may be on.

This website is a great way for me to exercise some web design while it being on a topic I find extremely interesting. I can use this project to showcase my investigation and journalistic writing skills.
